Project Description:
--------------------

The goal of this project is to develope a technique to use 
gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo detectors
of coalescing systems of neutron stars in binaries to 
generate sky-maps, and then combine them with catalogs of 
galaxies to get statistical measurement of the Hubble
constant. This technique is going to complement the existing
blind-statistical technique using binary black hole coalescence.
The advantage of this technique is that it reduces the statistical
trials-factor of a completely blind search by incorporating
electromagnetic observations from telescopes. The electromagnetic
observations are the various candidates that are found in the 
follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave triggers. The 
trials-factor that we will encounter in this case will be the 
false-positives rate from the various non-related transients in 
the searched volume, which is orders of magnitude smaller than 
the trials factor in the blind search that comes from the large 
number of galaxies in the searched volume. On the other hand
this method is less powerful than a targeted search (for which
an electromagnetic counterpart is already found). However, we 
only have one such candidate, and our compact binary rates estimates
suggest that such events will be extremely rate. Thus this new method
sits very nicely between the two techniques of blind search and 
targeted search, complementing the shortcoming of the both.
